# To Do List

## Concerning EmulateMPC_Œº

We need procedures performing the following

1. **MATRIX over FF** √ó **VECTOR over FFŒº**
2. **VECTOR over FFŒº** √ó **MATRIX over FF** 

Remark. We need to check if **Œì** belongs to FF or FFŒº. If it is the former then **2.**, if not then we will need also

3. **VECTOR over FFŒº** √ó **MATRIX over FFŒº**

We can split the calculations of `(S + rnd‚Çõ)(C + rndùí∏)` to avoid the "mixed" addition of matrices in FF and FFŒº.
Then, we will need

4. **Matrix over FF** + **Matrix over FFŒº**  
5. **Matrix over FF** √ó **Matrix over FF**


Additionally, we need to add the functions

6. `SplitCodeword()`
7. `Flatten()`

## Concerning EmulateParty_Œº

7. **VECTOR over FF** √ó **Element in FFŒº**

## Some comments/suggestions

For any function we add, we should include its respective tests.
Once all the tests successfully pass, then we should implement `EmulateMPC_Œº()` and `EmulateParty_Œº()`.
